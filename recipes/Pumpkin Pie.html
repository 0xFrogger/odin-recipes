    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>We have over 130 recipes for homemade pumpkin pie here at Allrecipes, but this
        recipe takes the cake (or pie) with over 2,600 five-star ratings. And it's
        proof that a good recipe doesn't necessarily need to be a complicated
        one â€” you get a great result with canned pumpkin puree and store-bought pie
        crust. Of course, you can customize it to suit your preferences by using
        fresh pumpkin or a <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipes/818/desserts/pies/pie-crusts/">homemade pie crust</a>
        for that from-scratch taste. Plus, it can be made ahead of time and
        refrigerated (or frozen) until you're ready to serve! Your search for the
        perfect pumpkin pie ends here.</p>
